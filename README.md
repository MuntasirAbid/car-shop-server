Car Store API 🚗
A RESTful API for managing car listings and processing customer orders. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) cars, place orders, and track revenue from sales.

📌 Features
✅ Car Management

Add new cars with brand, model, year, price, category, and stock quantity.
Retrieve a list of all available cars or filter by brand, model, or category.
Get details of a specific car by its ID.
Update car details (e.g., price, quantity).
Delete a car from the database.
✅ Order Management

Customers can place an order by providing their email and selecting a car.
Orders reduce the available stock of the selected car.
If stock reaches 0, the car is marked as "out of stock".
Prevents orders if requested quantity is greater than available stock.
✅ Revenue Calculation

Aggregates total revenue from all orders in the system.
Retrieves the sum of all completed purchases.
✅ Error Handling

Handles invalid inputs, missing data, and insufficient stock.
Returns clear error messages with HTTP status codes.
✅ Timestamps

All data includes createdAt and updatedAt timestamps for tracking.
